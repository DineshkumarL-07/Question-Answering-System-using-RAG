# Question-Answering-System-using-RAG
- Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architectural approach that can improve the efficacy of large language model (LLM) applications by leveraging custom data.
- The Question Answering System (QAS) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) system designed to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries/questions. It features a user-friendly interface where users can upload their documents and ask questions related to the content.

- The main three compoents of the model is,

- The tools and technologies mainly used in QAS model is Langchain for LLMs, ChromaDB for vector Databse, Pandas, Gradio for design user Interface, OpenAI for embedding models and GPT 3.5 for language model

- The workflow and architecture of the model using RAG is,
